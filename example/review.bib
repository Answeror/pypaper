abstract = {Human motion tracking for rehabilitation has been an active research topic since the 1980s. It has been motivated by the increased number of patients who have suffered a stroke, or some other motor function disability. Rehabilitation is a dynamic process which allows patients to restore their functional capability to normal. To reach this target, a patients’ activities need to be continuously monitored, and subsequently corrected. This paper reviews recent progress in human movement detection/tracking systems in general, and existing or potential application for stroke rehabilitation in particular. Major achievements in these systems are summarised, and their merits and limitations individually presented. In addition, bottleneck problems in these tracking systems that remain open are highlighted, along with possible solutions. },

Situation identification is an enabling technology that resolves noisy

interesting to applications. We provide a comprehensive analysis of the
nature and characteristics of situations, discuss the complexities of
situation identification, and review the techniques that are most

Innumerable applications can be visualized, for instance, in medical, security, entertainment, and tactical scenarios. Despite human activity recognition (HAR) being an active field for more than a decade, there are still key aspects that, if addressed, would constitute a significant turn in the way people interact with mobile devices. This paper surveys the state of the art in HAR based on wearable sensors. A general architecture is first presented along with a description of the main components of any HAR system. We also propose a two-level taxonomy in accordance to the learning approach (either supervised or semi-supervised) and the response time (either offline or online). Then, the principal issues and challenges are discussed, as well as the main solutions to each one of them. Twenty eight systems are qualitatively evaluated in terms of recognition performance, energy consumption, obtrusiveness, and flexibility, among others. Finally, we present some open problems and ideas that, due to their high relevance, should be addressed in future research.},

important for understanding relations between physical activity and

include behavioral observation, questionnaires in the form of diaries,

heart rate, calorimetry, and motion sensors. The doubly labeled water
method has become the gold standard for the validation of field methods
of assessing physical activity. Then, questionnaires show a low
reliability and validity but can be adequately applied as an
activity-ranking instrument. The heart rate requires individual
calibration to be an effective method to assess physical activity only
at group level. The indicated method for the assessment of habitual
physical activity in daily life is a doubly labeled water validated
accelerometer. Future developments are simultaneous measurement of body
acceleration and heart rate for the assessment of physical fitness. A
new generation of accelerometers will provide information on body
posture and activity recognition to allow objective assessment of
subjects' habitual activities, options for a healthy change, and effects

abstract = {Human motion analysis is receiving increasing attention from computer vision researchers. This interest is motivated by a wide spectrum of applications, such as athletic performance analysis, surveillance, man-machine interfaces, content-based image storage and retrieval, and video conferencing. The paper gives an overview of the various tasks involved in motion analysis of the human body. The authors focus on three major areas related to interpreting human motion: 1) motion analysis involving human body parts, 2) tracking of human motion using single or multiple cameras, and 3) recognizing human activities from image sequences. Motion analysis of human body parts involves the low-level segmentation of the human body into segments connected by joints, and recovers the 3D structure of the human body using its 2D projections over a sequence of images. Tracking human motion using a single or multiple camera focuses on higher-level processing, in which moving humans are tracked without identifying specific parts of the body structure. After successfully matching the moving human image from one frame to another in image sequences, understanding the human movements or activities comes naturally, which leads to a discussion of recognizing human activities. The review is illustrated by examples},

abstract = {Obesity represents a strong risk factor for developing chronic diseases.
Strategies for disease prevention often promote lifestyle changes
encouraging participation in physical activity. However, determining
what amount of physical activity is necessary for achieving specific
health benefits has been hampered by the lack of accurate instruments
for monitoring physical activity and the related physiological outcomes.
This review aims at presenting recent advances in activity-monitoring
technology and their application to support interventions for health
promotion. Activity monitors have evolved from step counters and
measuring devices of physical activity duration and intensity to more
advanced systems providing quantitative and qualitative information on
the individuals' activity behavior. Correspondingly, methods to predict
activity-related energy expenditure using bodily acceleration and
subjects characteristics have advanced from linear regression to
innovative algorithms capable of determining physical activity types and
the related metabolic costs. These novel techniques can monitor modes of
sedentary behavior as well as the engagement in specific activity types
that helps to evaluate the effectiveness of lifestyle interventions. In
conclusion, advances in activity monitoring have the potential to
support the design of response-dependent physical activity
recommendations that are needed to generate effective and personalized
lifestyle interventions for health promotion. International Journal of

abstract = {Objectives: To systematically review the literature on physical activity
variables derived from body-worn sensors during long term monitoring in
healthy and in-care older adults.
Methods: Using pre-designed inclusion and exclusion criteria, a PubMed
search strategy was designed to trace relevant reports of studies. Last
search date was March 8, 2011.
Study selection: Studies that included persons with mean or median age
of >65 years, used accelerometer-based body-worn sensors with a
monitoring length of >24 h, and reported values on physical activity in
the samples assessed.
Results: 1403 abstracts were revealed and 134 full-text papers included
in the final review. A variety of variables derived from activity counts
or recognition of performed activities were reported in healthy older
adults as well as in in-care older adults. Three variables were possible
to compare across studies, level of Energy Expenditure in kcal per day
and activity recognition in terms of total time in walking and total
activity. However, physical activity measured by these variables
demonstrated large variation between studies and did not distinguish
activity between healthy and in-care samples.
Conclusion: There is a rich variety in methods used for data collection
and analysis as well as in reported variables. Different aspects of
physical activity can be described, but the variety makes it challenging
to compare across studies. There is an urgent need for developing
consensus on activity monitoring protocols and which variables to
report. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {The past decade has witnessed a rapid proliferation of video cameras in all walks of life and has resulted in a tremendous explosion of video content. Several applications such as content-based video annotation and retrieval, highlight extraction and video summarization require recognition of the activities occurring in the video. The analysis of human activities in videos is an area with increasingly important consequences from security and surveillance to entertainment and personal archiving. Several challenges at various levels of processing-robustness against errors in low-level processing, view and rate-invariant representations at midlevel processing and semantic representation of human activities at higher level processing-make this problem hard to solve. In this review paper, we present a comprehensive survey of efforts in the past couple of decades to address the problems of representation, recognition, and learning of human activities from video and related applications. We discuss the problem at two major levels of complexity: 1) "actions" and 2) "activities." "Actions" are characterized by simple motion patterns typically executed by a single human. "Activities" are more complex and involve coordinated actions among a small number of humans. We will discuss several approaches and classify them according to their ability to handle varying degrees of complexity as interpreted above. We begin with a discussion of approaches to model the simplest of action classes known as atomic or primitive actions that do not require sophisticated dynamical modeling. Then, methods to model actions with more complex dynamics are discussed. The discussion then leads naturally to methods for higher level representation of complex activities.},

This technology has the potential to be used in automated activity profiling systems which produce a continuous record of activity patterns over extended periods of time. Such activity profiling systems are dependent on classification algorithms which can effectively interpret body-worn sensor data and identify different activities. This article reviews the different techniques which have been used to classify normal activities and/or identify falls from body-worn sensor data. The review is structured according to the different analytical techniques and illustrates the variety of approaches which have previously been applied in this field. Although significant progress has been made in this important area, there is still significant scope for further work, particularly in the application of advanced classification techniques to problems involving many different activities.},
